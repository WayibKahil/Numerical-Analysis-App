4. **Export Results**: Use the export feature to save your results as a PDF.

## Methods Supported 🔍

The Numerical Analysis App supports several numerical methods, including:

- **Bisection Method**: A root-finding method that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects a subinterval in which a root exists.
- **Cramer’s Rule**: A method for solving systems of linear equations using determinants.
- **False Position Method**: A root-finding algorithm that combines the bisection method and linear interpolation.
- **Fixed Point Iteration**: A method for finding roots of equations by iterating on a function.
- **Gauss Elimination**: A method for solving linear systems by transforming the system into an upper triangular form.
- **LU Decomposition**: A method that factors a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: An iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.
- **Secant Method**: A root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines.
